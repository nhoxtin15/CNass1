There are a jlink for client side in the directory ''/CLient/target/app/bin'', The jlink is compatible with ARM64 Apple Silicon device. There are also a jar file for client side.\

To run all the jar file ( Client or Server side), we are using java sdk 21.0.1 (for both Client and Server) and newest javafx (for CLient).\

You'll need to run the Server first. Then in the Terminal, it will ask you to enter the amount of Client you would like to allow. (Keep in mind, disconnect client will still take that place and not go anywhere).\

Then you can run the Client, You can choose which folder to share, and also folder to storing all the fetched files. Finally enter the Server IP and run.
